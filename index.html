                <br>
                <p>Today, we thank You for the precious life of Majesty. As she celebrates another year, We lift her up before You with a heart full of gratitude and expectation. Let this new season be marked by Your overwhelming love, divine purpose, and unstoppable joy.

                    Lord, may she trust in You with all her heart, never leaning on her own understanding but acknowledging You in every step she takes. Make her paths straight and bathe them in Your light.</p><br>
                    
                    <p>Surround her with Your favor like a shield—let her walk in rooms where only grace could take her, and let doors open before her not by might or merit, but by Your goodness. 
                    
                    Let Your joy be her strength, God. When life feels heavy, let laughter rise from her soul and let peace guard her thoughts. May her spirit remain light, lifted by Your presence.</p><br>
                    
                    <p>Father, as You’ve declared in Your word, You know the plans You have for her—plans to prosper her and not to harm her, to give her a future filled with hope. Unfold those plans before her, step by step. Let her dreams align with heaven’s blueprint. 
                    
                    Direct her heart into the fullness of Your love and the steady perseverance of Christ. Let her love boldly, forgive freely, and walk in patience that outlasts the storms. 
                    
                    And when the noise of the world tries to steal her peace, let her mind remain steadfast in You. Keep her in perfect peace—quiet, whole, and unshaken.</p><br>
                    
                    Lord, this is more than a birthday—it’s a new beginning. A fresh canvas. A year soaked in promise and possibility. Walk with her, whisper to her, and bless her more than she can imagine.
                    
                    In Jesus' name,
                    Amen.</p>
